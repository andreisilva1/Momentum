**Momentum** is a web application for managing projects and tasks in teams, in the Kanban/Board style.  
With it, teams can organize their workflows into **boards, lists, and tasks**, assigning responsibilities and deadlines and tracking progress in real time.

## ‚ú® Features

-   üë• **Team management** ‚Äì create organizations, add members, and manage your organization as you wish!

-   üìã **Boards and tasks** ‚Äì organize projects into visual boards, knowing the classification and deadline for your assigned tasks.
    
-   ‚úÖ **Assignments** ‚Äì assign tasks to specific users.

-   ‚è± **Status and deadlines** ‚Äì easily track progress and deadlines.
    

-   üîí **JWT authentication** ‚Äì secure login with access control.


The following guide will detail the entire process for configuring and using **Momentum** locally, using **React** for the front-end and **FastAPI** for the back-end. The web version of the project + API will be available soon!

# Full-stack Project Setup Guide

This guide details the process of setting up and running the **Momentum - Workflow Manager** project, which uses **React** on the frontend, **FastAPI** on the backend and **SQLite**             for databases.

## 1. Initial Repository Setup

First, clone the project from GitHub and navigate to the main directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/andreisilva1/Momentum.git
cd momentum

```

## 2. Backend Setup (FastAPI)

The backend is built with Python and FastAPI. Follow these steps to configure the environment and dependencies.

### 2.1 Virtual Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

**Linux/macOS:**

```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

```

**Windows (PowerShell):**

```
cd backend
python -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate

```

### 2.2 Installing Dependencies

Install all necessary Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 2.3 Environment Variables

Create the `.env` file from the `.env.example` template to store your environment variables, such as API credentials.

**Linux/macOS:**

```
cp .env.example .env

```

**Windows:**

```
copy .env.example .env

```

Open the `.env` file and update the values according to your local configuration (if necessary).

## 3. Frontend Setup (React)

The frontend uses React. Follow these steps to install the Node.js dependencies.

### 3.1 Installing Dependencies

Navigate back to the main directory, then to the `frontend` directory to install the npm dependencies.

```
cd ../frontend
npm install

```

### 3.2 Environment Variables

Just like the backend, create the `.env` file for the frontend.

**Linux/macos:**

```
cp .env.example .env

```

**Windows:**

```
copy .env.example .env

```

Update the variables if necessary (for example, `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000`).

## 4. Running the Application


### 4.1. Backend (FastAPI)

Navigate back to the `backend` directory and start the FastAPI server. The server will automatically reload on source code changes.

```
cd ../backend
venv\scripts\activate
fastapi run

```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 4.2. Frontend (React)
Navigate to the `frontend` directory and start the React development server.

```
cd ../frontend
npm run dev

```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 5. Testing and Documentation

You can test the application by navigating to the frontend in your browser and exploring the interactive API documentation.

-   **Frontend:**  `http://localhost:5173`
    
-   **Interactive API Documentation:**  `http://localhost:8000/docs` or `https://localhost:8000/scalar`
    

## Notes

-   Always use `.env.example` as a template.
    
-   **Python 3.11+** and **Node.js 18+** must be installed for full application functionality.
